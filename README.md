# LangSwitch
LangSwitch is a super-simple macOS app that switches your keyboard languages (input sources) one by one by pressing the Fn/🌐 button. It aims to address the annoyance caused by the default macOS function, which includes a popup and a delay between source changes. The sole purpose of this app is to immediately change the language without any popups or delays.
